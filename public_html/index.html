<h3>Welcome to David G. Sayles Insurance Services</h3>
<p style = "font-weight : bold">Lets take a moment to pat ourselves on the back for receiving the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America's 'Best Practices Agency' award for the second year running!</p>
<p>Welcome to David G. Sayles Insurance Services. We came to the Web in 1996 with the intent to provide a useful resource for our clients and the general public. If you would like to <a href = 'mailto:insureme@dsayles.com'>e-mail</a> us, we would be pleased to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>Included are <a href = './pages/about/companies.html'>links to our companies</a>.  For the general public we have developed a <a href = './pages/dic/dic.html'>dictionary of insurance terms</a> and a list of links to other insurance resources. Presently, the <a href = './pages/comins/marine.html'>marine insurance</a> section of the site is the most fully developed, and if you have interest in domestic or international trade, you may find this information helpful. For other areas of insurance coverage, we have provided individual pages found by selecting one of the categories above.<p>
<p>While this site does convey information regarding our business, its main focus is that of a repository of information.  We hope you find all enclosed articles informative and useful.</p>

<h5>Mission Statement</h5>
<p>Our mission statement is quite simple: To provide a high level of insurance and related products, service and quality insurance companies to our customers. Because we act as agents and brokers we only make money when the client is satisfied.</p>
