<h3>Commercial Insurance - Bonds</h3>
<h5>Contract, Court and Federal Bonds</h5>
<p>Bonds are generally divided into two types, Fidelity Bonds and Surety Bonds. Both types differ from insurance in that they always have three parties central to the contract: a Principal (the entity or person that might cause the loss), an Obligee (the entity that collects under the bond, should the principal cause a loss) and a Surety (the entity that pays the loss, such as an insurance company).</p>
<h5>Fidelity Bonds</h5>
<p>Fidelity Bonds are technically a form of Surety Bonds, but are usually considered a distinct product. They are issued as a guarantee against loss due to employee dishonesty. As such, they are an important part of a company's insurance program, since they cover areas not covered in the company's Liability and Property Coverages. For many businesses, an employee's dishonest act is a principal area of their insurable risks, and Fidelity Bonds can provide that protection</p>
<p>Fidelity Bonds come in several forms, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Individual Bonds</strong>, in which an individual employee is bonded. Individual Bonds are not standardized. They can be easily used for unusual situations or activities, and can be specially scripted.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduled Bonds</strong>, in which individual positions (called a Positions Schedule Bond) or named individuals (called a Name Schedule Bond) are covered.  An example of this would be all branch personnel or tellers in a specific bank.</li>
<li><strong>Blanket Bonds</strong> are used to cover all employees, providing the most complete coverage of the three types. The coverage is especially valuable due to the latitude given in demonstrating a covered loss. The employer doesn't need to show that a specific covered employee caused a loss. If the employer can show that an employee must have caused the loss then that loss will be covered.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery Bonds</strong> allows a first-time buyer of Fidelity Bonds to protect against undiscovered loss that occurred before the bond was issued. If you, as an employer, have just realized the need for a Fidelity Bond as part of your insurance coverage, you should also consider buying Discovery period coverage.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h5>Surety Bonds</h5>
<p>Surety bonds are issued to cover an extremely wide range of actions and situations. They are issued by surety companies, and can be classified into one of the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Contract Bonds</li>
<li>Court Bonds</li>
<li>Federal Bonds</li>
<li>License and Permit Bonds</li>
<li>Public Official Bonds</li>
<li>Other/Miscellaneous Bonds</li>
</ul>
