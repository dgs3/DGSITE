<h3>Personal Insurance - Personal Auto</h3>
<h5>Jet-Skiing: Watch Out!</h5>
<p>There are nearly one million jet-skis in the United States, and the number is increasing 30% per year.  With speeds exceeding a mile a minute, these personal watercraft can be dangerous even in experienced hands.  In some states, these watercraft are not required to follow boating laws.  Licenses are not required to operate these craft, but they're recommended.  In some locations, operators 14 to 18 years old must take a boat safety course.  Think safety before turning kids loose on a jet-ski.</p>
<h5>Waterways are like Highways</h5>
<p>Even though the perils of waterways parallel those of highways, the majority of mariners do not have an insurance policy that will compensate you if they injure your family or your watercraft.  Protecting your family and your equipment against the negligence of others is as important as protecting yourself from watercraft accidents of your own.  The best protection, of course, is insurance.</p>
<p>Homeowners Coverage is limited to small watercraft.  Watercraft Insurance provides a much broader protection plan including property damage and medical expenses.  Watercraft premiums are based on a number of factors, including the owner's driving record.  One way to reduce the premium is to take a boat safety course.  Another possibility is to carry Watercraft Insurance with the same company that insures your home or car.</p>
<p>Whether you're on the roadway or waterway, safety precautions and insurance protection are undoubtedly the right way to go.</p>
