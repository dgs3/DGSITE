<h3>Broad Form Property Coverage including Completed Operations</h3>
<p>A coverage extension that is of great value to the general contractor as respects completed operations property damage liability claims. Without it, the normal Comprehensive General Liability policy will not respond for completed operations claims (i.e., claims rising out of work performed on behalf of the Insured by subcontractors). With this coverage extension, this exposure is covered. Additional broadening coverage features are also included, but none as important as the above to the general contractor.  See also: Dwelling Property, Homeowners Policy.</p>
