<h3>Insurance Verification - Check Others Insurance Policy</h3>
<p>Are you sure the people you are dealing with have their own insurance policy? Are you a landlord, a lender, or for whatever reason do you have lots of people (non-customers) coming onto your property? If so, you may want to check their insurance. If they aren't, and they cause damage to your property, you can be on the hook--and that can get expensive.</p>
<p>We can be sure the third party does have an insurance policy. Our insurance certificate tracking can confirm insurance of third parties, helping to lower your potential liability claims and your insurance costs.  In order to verify a third party's insurance, please gather in information listed below:
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Telephone Number</li>
<li>Tax ID or Social Security Number</li>
<li>Insurance Agency Name</li>
<li>Insurance Agency Address</li>
<li>Insurance Agency Telephone Number</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Once we receive the above information, we'll contact the insurance agency, get proper evidence of insurance, and verify that information. Then, when the policy comes up for renewal, we'll automatically contact the insurance agency and confirm that there is still insurance in force. </p>
<p>You benefit from this process in two ways: you can lower your insurance price, since you'll be able to prove that all of these subcontractors have insurance; and the hassle of dealing with all that extra paperwork (plus follow-up telephone calls, and more paperwork, and more telephone calls) is taken out of your staff's hands. You will then be free to do what you do best: run your business!</p>
